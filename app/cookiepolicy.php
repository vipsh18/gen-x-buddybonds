		<div class="msg">
			Don't worry, I am not gonna show you the biggest document you have ever seen in the name of Cookie Policy
			like others. Nobody ever reads that completely. I wonder ðŸ¤” if the ones who write them do. Here's a short
			one
			just for you!
		</div>
		<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h4>
		<div class="msg">
			A <b>cookie</b> is a <b>small piece of data</b> stored on the user's computer or the server computer by a
			particular website when it is loaded in the browser. Cookies are usually used as a mechanism to remember
			stateful information like the contents of a user's shopping cart, login credentials of a user or user
			preferences either for a single visit that is a session cookie or a persistent cookie that stays with the
			user
			even when the browser is closed.<br>buddyBonds uses cookies in ways like <b>authenticating your account</b>
			and
			it's <b>precious data</b>.They help count the number of visitors to a page, keeping track of how many pages
			were
			visited in a day and stuff like that and last but not the least, give you a satisfying experience. Sometimes
			<a href="https://top.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-a-third-party-website" data-toggle="tooltip"
				title="Quora.com" target="_blank">third parties</a> also store
			cookies to serve content and provide advertising and analytics services on the website.<br>buddyBonds uses
			Google for providing analytics on the website. Basically just a bunch of cookies is stored on the user end
			and
			it helps me know how many visitors I have on my website everyday, which pages are liked the most by the
			users,
			what areas should I improve, where are the users from and similar things. In the end all of this leads to a
			promising and secure environment that is buddyBonds.
		</div>
		<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">WHAT INFORMATION IS STORED?</h4>
		<div class="msg">
			<b>Security</b>: Cookies are used to prevent security risks. Such
			cookies are used to store information about you so that no other person can access your account
			illegally.<br>The most basic and I can say important use of a cookie for buddyBonds is recognizing and
			authenticating that a user is who he/she claims to be!<br><br><b>Functionality</b> : Cookies are used for a
			lot of functionality in buddyBonds.
			However there are some other ways to do that too, but a cookie also helps in keeping a user logged in
			his/her
			account. Otherwise just imagine how hectic and boring would that be for you to login everytime you open your
			browser and just want to see your favourite posts right away or want to message your buddy instantly. If
			your
			browser has blocked cookies that will greatly affect the availaibility of buddyBonds services.
			<div><br>By using buddyBonds I assume you agree to our use of cookies.</div>

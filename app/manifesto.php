			Of course! In today's digital world where the number of real connections between people are
			reduced to minimum there needs to be some way to keep them connected. That is the quality of social
			networks.<br>There have been many social networks in the past and will be many in the future to come and as
			time flies these networks become more and more confusing and bigger. So the need of the hour was a
			<b>simple</b>,<b> secure</b> and a not-so confusing network where people could communicate and share their
			activities or photos just
			with a touch.<br><br>And that is when I thought of <b>buddyBonds</b>. As the name suggests this network
			believes in
			building bonds, building connections and not only connections, but <b>real connections</b>. You just have
			to pass this thought on to your buddies. Help me in making buddyBonds a successful mission and become a part
